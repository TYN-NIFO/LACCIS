# LACCIS - Legal Clause Classification Intelligence System

## Project Description
LACCIS is a modern, responsive web application designed for legal document management with intelligent clause classification. It allows legal teams to seamlessly manage clients, who can upload and evaluate their contracts against standard templates. The system leverages AI tools to extract text, classify clauses, assess risk, and perform semantic similarity checks against standard baseline documents.

## How to Run the Project (Installation & Setup)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ 
- Python 3.8+
- Neon DB (PostgreSQL database with `pgvector` extension)

### Backend Setup
1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Environment Configuration:**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory (refer to the Environment Variables section below).
5. **Start the FastAPI server:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Complete Project Flows

1. Users authenticate in NIFO and open Legal Analyzer through the main application.
2. The legal admin can add legal members and clients, and access is resolved from Legal Analyzer's local database.
3. The legal team can invite clients via email by providing a username and password. The email is sent using EmailJS for contractual onboarding, not for primary app authentication.
4. The client and legal team can communicate via chat.
5. When a client logs in for the first time, an NDA uploaded by the legal team (in the standard templates section of the legal dashboard) is automatically shared with the client.
6. The client can either accept or reject the document. If the client rejects it, they can upload either a redlined document or their own contract.
7. In the case of a redlined document, the uploaded file is displayed in the legal team’s client workspace. When the legal team clicks "Review," the redlined contract opens in Google Docs, where they can manually accept or reject changes.
8. In the case of a client’s own contract:
   - The uploaded contract is processed to extract and classify clauses.
   - These clauses are compared with standard clauses using SBERT.
   - Based on similarity scores, a threshold is applied to classify risks as Low, Medium, or High, with risk tagging for each clause.
   - The legal team can review all risks in a side-by-side viewer, where standard clauses are shown on one side and the client’s clauses on the other.
   - When a specific clause is selected, the legal team can run AI analysis to understand why it is considered risky.
   - The legal team can edit and comment on the client’s clauses.
   - Finally, the edited version can be downloaded and shared with the client, who can view it as a redlined document in Google Docs.
9. The legal team can also interact with an AI assistant for general queries regarding clauses.
10. This workflow (both redlined and own contract flows) applies to all contract types such as RA, SOW, and MSA.
11. Once both the client and legal team accept the document, they can upload the final contract and mark it as finalized. The legal team makes the final decision, and the finalized document is displayed on both the legal and client dashboards.
